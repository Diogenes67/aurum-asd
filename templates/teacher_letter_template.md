Dear \[Teacher Name\],

Thank you for your contribution to the neurodevelopmental assessment for
\[Student Name\]. This letter summarises the assessment findings and
provides recommendations to support \[his/her/their\] learning,
participation, and wellbeing at school. A copy has also been provided to
\[his/her/their\] parents/carers and GP.

1. Quick Snapshot (Key Information for Classroom)
=================================================

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Diagnostic Outcome:** \[Student Name\] has received a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder / does not meet criteria for ASD / requires further assessment. \[Brief 1-2 sentence summary of key findings relevant to classroom.\]
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Strengths & Interests:**

-   \[Strength 1 - e.g., Excellent visual memory; can recall detailed
    information about topics of interest\]

-   \[Strength 2 - e.g., Strong focus and persistence when engaged with
    preferred activities\]

-   \[Strength 3 - e.g., Creative thinking; generates unique solutions
    to problems\]

-   \[Interest areas - e.g., dinosaurs, Minecraft, trains, space - can
    be used for engagement\]

**Communication Profile:**

-   \[How student best receives information - e.g., responds well to
    visual instructions; needs processing time\]

-   \[How student expresses themselves - e.g., may use scripted
    language; prefers written to verbal\]

-   \[What to avoid - e.g., avoid sarcasm/idioms; don\'t assume silence
    means understanding\]

**Sensory Profile:**

-   \[Sensitivities - e.g., noise sensitivity (assemblies, playground);
    visual clutter; certain textures\]

-   \[Seeking behaviours - e.g., needs movement breaks; seeks deep
    pressure\]

-   \[Effective regulation strategies - e.g., fidget tool, quiet corner,
    headphones, movement break\]

**Key Supports to Start Now:**

1.  \[Priority adjustment 1 - e.g., Provide visual schedule on desk;
    preview any changes to routine\]

2.  \[Priority adjustment 2 - e.g., Allow noise-reducing headphones
    during independent work and assemblies\]

3.  \[Priority adjustment 3 - e.g., Give 5-minute warning before
    transitions; use visual timer\]

4.  \[Priority adjustment 4 - e.g., Offer movement breaks every 20-30
    minutes or access to regulation space\]

5.  \[Priority adjustment 5 - e.g., Seat away from high-traffic areas;
    near teacher for easy check-ins\]

**Safety & Wellbeing Considerations:**

-   \[Any medical needs - e.g., allergies, medications, seizures\]

-   \[Elopement/wandering risk if applicable\]

-   \[Emotional regulation concerns - e.g., meltdown triggers, early
    warning signs\]

-   \[Social vulnerability - e.g., bullying risk, difficulty recognising
    social manipulation\]

3. Reasonable Adjustments (Disability Standards for Education 2005)
===================================================================

*Under the Disability Standards for Education 2005, \[Student Name\] is
entitled to reasonable adjustments to enable participation in education
on the same basis as peers. The following adjustments are recommended
based on assessment findings.*

3.1 Universal Design for Learning (Class-Wide Strategies)
---------------------------------------------------------

These strategies benefit all learners and reduce the need for individual
accommodations:

**Engagement:**

-   Preview changes to routine; use visual countdowns for transitions

-   Offer choice in task order or response format where possible

-   Build in scheduled movement breaks for whole class

**Representation:**

-   Use visual schedules and agendas displayed in classroom

-   Provide step-by-step task cards; pre-teach key vocabulary

-   Show examples and models of completed work

**Action & Expression:**

-   Allow flexible response formats (oral, visual, typed, drawn)

-   Provide scaffolded templates and graphic organisers

-   Chunk multi-step tasks into smaller components

3.2 Individualised Adjustments
------------------------------

  **Need/Barrier**                       **Adjustment**                                                            **When/Where**                  **Responsible**           **Success Indicator**
  -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------- ------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  \[e.g., Auditory sensitivity\]         \[e.g., Noise-reducing headphones; access to quiet space\]                \[e.g., All day; assemblies\]   \[e.g., Class teacher\]   \[e.g., Attends assemblies 3/4 weeks; fewer distress episodes\]
  \[e.g., Task initiation difficulty\]   \[e.g., First-Then card; task initiation checklist; individual prompt\]   \[e.g., Each new task\]         \[e.g., SSO/Teacher\]     \[e.g., Starts task within 2 min with ≤1 prompt\]
  \[e.g., Transition difficulty\]        \[e.g., 5-min warning + visual timer + transition visual\]                \[e.g., All transitions\]       \[e.g., Teacher\]         \[e.g., Smooth transitions 4/5 days\]
  \[Add more rows as needed\]                                                                                                                                                

4. Assessment & Classroom Participation

**Assessment Adjustments:**

-   \[e.g., Extra time (time and a half / double time)\]

-   \[e.g., Reduced distraction environment; separate supervision\]

-   \[e.g., Alternative response formats (oral, typed, scribed)\]

-   \[e.g., Supervised breaks; rest breaks as needed\]

**Group Work & Social Participation:**

-   \[e.g., Explicit role cards for group tasks; structured
    turn-taking\]
