## 4. Functional Capacity & Impact

*For each domain: What {Name} cannot do without support*

### Communication
**Current capacity:** {How they communicate}
**Without support:** {e.g., Unable to communicate needs to unfamiliar people; cannot follow instructions without visual support}
**Support needed:** {e.g., Speech pathology, AAC, visual supports}

### Social Participation
**Current capacity:** {How they interact}
**Without support:** {e.g., Cannot participate in group activities; excluded from peer play}
**Support needed:** {e.g., Social skills intervention, support worker for community access}

### Self-Care & Daily Living
**Current capacity:** {Current skills, compare to age}
**Without support:** {e.g., Cannot dress independently; requires prompting for all self-care}
**Support needed:** {e.g., OT for daily living skills, parent capacity building}

### Sensory Regulation
**Current capacity:** {Sensory profile}
**Without support:** {e.g., Cannot access busy environments; meltdowns prevent participation}
**Support needed:** {e.g., OT sensory program, sensory equipment}

### Learning & Emotional Regulation
**Current capacity:** {Learning style, emotional regulation}
**Without support:** {e.g., Cannot complete tasks independently; requires co-regulation}
**Support needed:** {e.g., Psychology, education support}

### Safety
**Risks:** {e.g., Elopement risk, no road safety awareness, self-injury during meltdowns}
**Support needed:** {e.g., Constant supervision, 1:1 support in community}
