Dear Dr \[Name\],

Thank you for referring \[Client Name\] for neurodevelopmental
assessment. \[He/She/They\] was seen at \[Clinic Name\] on \[Assessment
Dates\] for a Comprehensive Needs Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation
to consider whether \[he/she/they\] meets criteria for Autism Spectrum
Disorder and/or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

Diagnostic Outcome
==================

*\[SELECT AND COMPLETE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:\]*

***Option A (Positive Diagnosis):***

Based on the assessment findings, \[Client Name\] meets diagnostic
criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR
(American Psychiatric Association, 2022). \[He/She/They\] demonstrates
persistent differences in social communication and social interaction,
along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or
activities. These characteristics have been present from early childhood
and impact \[his/her/their\] everyday functioning.

***Option B (Does Not Meet Criteria):***

Based on the assessment findings, \[Client Name\] does not meet
diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by the
DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). While \[he/she/they\]
demonstrates \[describe relevant features observed\], these do not meet
the threshold required for diagnosis. \[Alternative
considerations/differential diagnoses may include\...\]

***Option C (Further Assessment Required):***

Based on current assessment findings, we are unable to confirm or
exclude a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder with high confidence at
this time. \[Describe reasons, e.g., young age, masking, complexity of
presentation, need for additional information\]. We recommend
\[reassessment in X months / referral to consensus team / additional
assessments\].
