## About This Report

This report brings together what we learned from you, from {Name}'s school, and from our assessments. It explains **how {Name} experiences the world** and lists **supports** that can help at home and school.

**What this report is:**
- A shared understanding of {Name}
- A starting point for supports
- Something we update together as {Name} grows

**What this report is not:**
- A judgement of you or your parenting
- A fixed label that limits {Name}'s future
- The final word—you know your child best

We used a {neurodiversity-affirming / strengths-focused} approach, meaning we focus on what helps {Name} thrive rather than what is "wrong."

---

## Understanding {Name}

*Each section describes how {Name} experiences this area and what helps.*

### Communication

**How {Name} communicates:**
{Describe current communication: words, signs, device, gestures, echolalia. Note what helps them understand.}

**What helps:**
- {e.g., Use short sentences}
- {e.g., Give processing time—wait 5 seconds}
- {e.g., Pair words with visuals}

---

### Connecting with others

**How {Name} relates to people:**
{Describe social preferences: one-on-one vs groups, shared interests, parallel play, eye contact comfort.}

**What helps:**
- {e.g., Structured play with clear rules}
- {e.g., Side-by-side activities}
- {e.g., Explicit social scripts for common situations}

---

### Sensory experience

**{Name}'s sensory profile:**
{Describe patterns: sound sensitivity, movement seeking, touch preferences, visual or smell sensitivities.}

**What helps:**
- {e.g., Noise-cancelling headphones in busy places}
- {e.g., Movement breaks every 20 minutes}
- {e.g., Dim lighting at home in the evening}

**About meltdowns:**
Meltdowns are signs of overwhelm, not misbehaviour. Recognising early cues helps you support {Name} before things get big.

| Early signs | What to try |
|-------------|-------------|
| {e.g., covering ears} | {e.g., offer headphones, move to quiet space} |
| {e.g., pacing} | {e.g., offer movement break} |

---

### Flexibility and change

**What's hard:**
{Describe: transitions, unexpected changes, unfinished tasks, new routines.}

**What's easier:**
{Describe: preferred routines, interests that provide focus.}

**What helps:**
- {e.g., Transition warnings: "5 minutes left"}
- {e.g., Visual schedule on the fridge}
- {e.g., First–Then cards for tricky moments}

---

### Daily living

**Current routines:**
{Describe: morning, meals, sleep, self-care skills.}

**What helps:**
- {e.g., Visual checklist for morning routine}
- {e.g., Same bedtime order each night}
- {e.g., Lay out clothes the night before}

---

## Supports That Work

> *Pick 2–3 to try for a week. Keep what works.*

### Morning routine
- {Specific strategy linked to Section 3 findings}
- {e.g., Visual checklist on bedroom door}

### Mealtimes
- {e.g., Offer safe foods plus one "learning" food nearby—no pressure}
- {e.g., Reduce sensory load: quieter room, preferred plate}

### Transitions
- {e.g., Timer + verbal warning: "When the timer beeps, we pack up"}
- {e.g., Transition object to carry between activities}

### Homework / learning at home
- {e.g., Short bursts with movement breaks}
- {e.g., Start with the preferred task to build momentum}

### Bedtime
- {e.g., Same routine each night: bath → book → lights out}
- {e.g., No screens 1 hour before bed}
- {e.g., Weighted blanket or deep pressure before sleep}

### Outings and new places
- {e.g., Preview with photos or video}
- {e.g., Bring calm kit: headphones, fidget, snack}
- {e.g., Plan a quiet escape spot}

## Working Together

### With school / early learning

Share a one-page summary with {Name}'s teacher. Ask about:
- A visual timetable for the day
- A quiet space when overwhelmed
- Movement breaks built into the schedule
- Clear home–school communication (what worked, what to try)

*A separate Teacher Report is available if needed.*

### With therapists

| Therapy | Focus | Home practice |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Speech pathology | {e.g., functional communication} | {e.g., offer choices throughout the day} |
| Occupational therapy | {e.g., sensory regulation, fine motor} | {e.g., 5-min heavy work before homework} |
| Psychology | {e.g., anxiety, emotional regulation} | {e.g., co-regulation: calm yourself first} |

---

## Next Steps

### Referrals
| Service | Why | Status |
